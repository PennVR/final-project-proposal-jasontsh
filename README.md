The first proposal is a "defend the castle" game.  The player would use different weapons, such as guns and swords, 
to fight incoming waves of enemies.  The player would be standing in the footstep of the castle, where different
monsters would approach the castle, either in the air or on the ground.  The goal is to hold the castle as long as possible.

The second proposal is a "kitchen cooking" game.  The player would receive orders and prepare the food simultaneously,
working around the environment in VR.  

The third proposal is a "Parallel universe" RPG game.  The player tries to survive in another space, 
by making their own food and weapons, fighting for 
weapons and advancing in story line to beat the game.
